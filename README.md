## Description

Fly-Fi is a single page, full-stack application, designed to locate flights on a flexible map. It can also authenticate users, and send notifications before arrival. Designed to alert people, when a specific flight is arriving, or see what is currently in the sky around them. With a clean UI, the user is able to see flights real time. When authenticated, the user can save, and get notifications via SMS ahead of time, when a plane is coming in for a landing. The user can keep a list of the flights they want to track.

## How it works:

Fly-fi was built using React.js, Axios and Sass for the front-end, Ruby on Rails for the backend and postgreSQL for database management.

FLy-Fi also leverages three different APIâ€™s:

- [Aviation-Edge](https://aviation-edge.com/) for live flight tracking data
- [Google-Maps-API](https://developers.google.com/maps/) utilizing [google-map-react](https://github.com/google-map-react/google-map-react)
- [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) for SMS notification

## Getting Started

## Installation

Front-End

```
cd frontend
npm install
```

Back-End

```
cd backend
rvm install 2.5.8
rvm use default 2.5.8
bundle install

rake db:reset
rake db:migrate
```

### Start Front-End

- open a terminal for frontend

```
cd frontend
npm start
```

### Start Back-End

- open two terminals for backend
- Note: VagrantVM has psql installed; if you are not using vagrant to run the backend, you will need to have postgreSQL running on your machine.

#Terminal 1

```
cd backend
bin/rails s -b 0.0.0.0 -p 3001
```

#Terminal 2

```
cd backend
rake jobs:work
```

## Configuration:

## API:

### Front end:

- Copy the .env-example file in the frontend directory, and rename it to .env.

- google-map-react: download an API key from [Google-Maps-API](https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started#enable-api-sdk).
- Replace the API key with yours, after REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API.

### Backend:

- Copy the .env-example file in the backend directory, and rename it to .env.

- Aviation-Edge: download an API key from Avaiation-Edge. Replace the API key with yours, after AVIATION_API_KEY.

- Twilo: sign up for a trial account at Twilio.com - you will need a working phone number to verify and to do testing with. Get a Twilio number with SMS capability. (This quickstart video from Twilio can help you get started).
- Replace the account sid with yours after TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID.
- Replace the auth tolken with yours after TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN.
- Replace the twilio default number with yours after TWILIO_DEFAULT_NUMBER.
- Replace any verified numbers for testing after TEST_NUMBER_ONE.

# App Features
